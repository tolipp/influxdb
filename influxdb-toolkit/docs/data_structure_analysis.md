# Data Structure Analysis (Placeholder)

## Purpose
Document how measurements, tags, and fields are structured in real v1 and v2 datasets.

## Status
Not executed yet. Requires read-only access to example databases and explicit confirmation.

## Planned Checks
- v1: list measurements and tag/field keys per measurement.
- v2: list measurements and field keys via schema functions.
- Compare tag usage patterns (device_id, sensor, station, etc.).
- Record any schema deviations that the wrapper must handle.

## Notes
When run, record the exact database/bucket name and query date for traceability.
